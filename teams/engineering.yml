# To add another team, create a new file in the teams/ directory and copy and paste the contents from this file.
# Update the secret in the new file, then create the corresponding secret in GitHub Actions secrets.
# Then add that secret to .github/workflows/workflow.yml as an env variable.
# The secret name in the YAML file must match the secret name in GitHub Actions secrets.
